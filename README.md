# coffee-machine
Project "Coffee Machine" was created to simulate, how coffee machine works.
It lets user buy a coffee (he can pick one from four available options), checks, if there are enough products to realize the order and counts how many there are left.
There is also a possibility to take money from machine (for example for some service guy).
